# Singleton Design Pattern

- The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 

- This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as in configuration management, logging, or connection pooling.

## Benefits

- Controlled instantiation.
  e.g.
  - You can have a single configuration manager that is accessed throughout the application.
  - You can ensure that there is only one instance of a database connection pool.
  - A single logging instance can be used to log messages from different parts of the application.

- Global access point.
  e.g.
  - The singleton instance can be accessed globally without passing it around.
  - This is particularly useful in large applications where many components need to access the same instance.

- Resource efficiency.
  e.g.
  - Reduces memory overhead by preventing multiple instances of a class.
  - Useful for managing shared resources like database connections or thread pools.

## Drawbacks

- Global state management.
  e.g.
  - Singletons can introduce global state into an application, making it harder to manage and reason about.
  - This can lead to unintended side effects if different parts of the application modify the singleton's state.

- Testing challenges.
  e.g.
  - Singletons can make unit testing difficult, as they introduce global state that can persist across tests.
  - This can lead to tests that are interdependent and harder to isolate.

- Concurrency issues.
  e.g.
  - In multi-threaded applications, care must be taken to ensure that the singleton instance is created in a thread-safe manner.
  - Without proper synchronization, multiple threads could create multiple instances of the singleton.

- Hidden dependencies.
  e.g.
  - Singletons can hide dependencies, making it harder to understand the relationships between different parts of the code.
  - This can lead to tightly coupled code that is difficult to maintain and refactor.
