## Training LLMs: Strategies And Challengies

### Key Considerations For Training Your Own LLMs

- It enables customization but increases training efforts.
- Requires large high-quality data.
- Requires lots of computational resources.
- Requires advanced tooling to operationalize.
- It saves costs and improves latency.
- It improves privacy, safety and inference speed.

### Factors To Consider When Selecting Your LLM

#### 1. Capability and Focus Area

- **Task-specific vs. General-purpose**: Do you need an LLM trained for a specific task like writing different kinds of creative content, or a more general-purpose model for a wider range of tasks like question answering and summarization?

- **Specialization**: Some LLMs are designed for specific domains like medicine, law, or finance. Consider if a specialized LLM would be more aligned with your needs.

#### 2. Performance and Accuracy

- **Accuracy**: How important is it for the LLM to generate outputs with high factual correctness and minimal bias? Evaluate the model's performance on relevant benchmarks.

Fluency and Coherence: Does the LLM generate text that reads naturally and flows logically?

#### 3. Technical Considerations

- **Model Size and Complexity**: Larger models generally offer better performance but come with higher computational demands and potentially greater cost.

- **Accessibility**: Is the LLM offered through a cloud service with a user-friendly API, or does it require in-house infrastructure and expertise to run?

#### 4. Cost and Licensing

- **Open-source vs. Proprietary**: Open-source LLMs offer more flexibility and lower costs, but may require technical expertise to use effectively. Proprietary LLMs might be more user-friendly but often come with licensing fees.

#### 5. Additional Factors

- **Safety and Bias**: Consider the LLM's potential for generating harmful content or perpetuating biases. Look for providers that address these issues responsibly.

- **Explainability and Transparency**: How well can you understand the reasoning behind the LLM's outputs? This can be important for tasks where trust and interpretability are crucial.

## Basics of Prompt Engineering

### What is Prompt Engineering?

- Prompt engineering is like giving instructions to a super-powered writer.
- It's the art of crafting prompts that get the most out of large language models (LLMs).

### What is a Prompt?

> A prompt is essentially a question, instruction, or statement that guides the LLM towards the desired output.
> It can include different elements:

- Instruction: This tells the LLM what you want it to do. Do you want it to write a poem, translate a text, answer a question, etc.?
- Context: Providing relevant background information helps the LLM understand the situation and generate a more focused response.
- Input Data: Sometimes you might give the LLM some starting information or an example to steer it in the right direction.
- Output Indicator: This can specify the format or style of the desired output, like a poem with a specific rhyme scheme.

### Why is Prompt Engineering Important?

> The way you craft your prompt significantly impacts the quality and relevance of the LLM's response. A well-designed prompt can:

- Increase Accuracy: Guide the LLM towards factually correct and unbiased outputs.
Enhance Creativity: Spark the LLM's imagination to produce creative text formats like poems, code, scripts, etc.
- Improve Specificity: Refine the LLM's focus to deliver outputs that precisely match your needs.

### What Makes A Good Prompt?

- **Clarity and Specificity**:
  - Use clear and concise language that the LLM can understand.
  - Be specific about what you want the LLM to do. Don't leave too much room for misinterpretation.

- **Context and Background**:
  - Provide relevant background information or context to help the LLM understand the situation.
  - This can improve the focus and accuracy of the response.

- **Structure and Format**:
  - Consider structuring your prompt with clear instructions, examples, and desired output format.
  - This can guide the LLM towards a more organized and relevant response.

- **Break Tasks**:
  - Break tasks into smaller subtasks. i.e. prompt chaining.

- **Examples and Counter-examples**:
  - Including a few good or bad examples can illustrate the desired outcome and steer the LLM in the right direction.

#### Basic Techniques

- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Simple and direct questions or instructions.
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing a few examples or relevant information alongside the instruction.
- **Template-Based Prompting**: Creating a template with placeholders for the LLM to fill.

#### Advanced Techniques

- **Prompt Combining**: Merging multiple prompts for a comprehensive instruction.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Breaking down complex tasks into a sequence of prompts for improved reasoning.
- **Meta-Prompting**: Experimentally developing a universal prompt adaptable to various tasks.

#### Specialized Techniques

- **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)**: Combining reasoning steps with actions within the prompt for analyses and proposed actions.
- **Symbolic Reasoning and PAL (Program-Aided LLMs)**: Integrating symbolic reasoning into prompts for enhanced problem-solving abilities.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** It's a technique that enhances the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval from external sources.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

> It's a technique that enhances the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval from external sources.
> Here's how RAG works:

- **User Prompt**: You provide a prompt or question to the LLM.

- **Retrieval**: The LLM searches a massive external knowledge base (like curated Wikipedia articles) to find relevant factual information that aligns with the prompt.

- **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is used to supplement the LLM's internal knowledge during the generation process.

- **Generation**: The LLM leverages its internal knowledge and the retrieved information to generate a response to your prompt. This response can be an answer to your question, a creative text format, or any other task the LLM is suited for.
