## Brief Introdution To LLMs

- LLMs, or large language models, are basically computer programs that can understand and generate human-like text.

- They're trained on massive amounts of data to understand the complexities of language.

- Breakdown of how they work:

  - **Training on mountains of data**: LLMs are trained on huge datasets of text and code, which can be anything from books and articles to websites and code repositories. This data helps them learn the patterns and rules of language.

  - **Neural network magic**:  They use a specific kind of neural network called a transformer model. This allows them to analyze relationships between words and sentences, which is essential for understanding language.

### Applications of LLMs

- Generate text, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, emails, and even letters.
- Translate languages.
- Write different kinds of creative content.
- Answer questions in a comprehensive and informative way.

### Popular Examples

- GPT 4
- Claude
- Gemini
- Llama 2
- Mistrai, etc.

### Challenges

- Requires lots of data.
- Requires lots of compute.
- Requires prompt engineering expertise.
- Challenging to train, track, deploy and manage.

## What Is LLMOps?
